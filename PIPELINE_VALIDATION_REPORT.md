## ⚠️ Known Issues & Warnings

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **React act() Warnings**: Form component tests need act() wrapping
   - **Impact**: Test warnings only, functionality unaffected
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Resolution**: Test code improvements needed

2. **SecurityMetrics Tests Skipped**: Authentication dependency
   - **Impact**: Test coverage gap in authenticated scenarios
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Resolution**: Mock authentication setup needed

3. **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**: 3 in serve package dependencies
   - **Impact**: Development tool only, no production impact
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Resolution**: Legacy dependency tree, isolated risk

### Recommendations for Improvement

#### Immediate (1-2 days)
- [ ] Fix React act() warnings in component tests
- [ ] Set up authentication mocks for SecurityMetrics tests
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions secrets validation

#### Short-term (1 week)
- [ ] Implement E2E testing with Playwright
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Set up staging environment automated testing

#### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Implement GitOps deployment patterns
- [ ] Add canary deployment capabilities
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting integration
