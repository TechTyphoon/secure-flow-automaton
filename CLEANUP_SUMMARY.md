- **Target**: Keep 10 most recent, delete 29 older runs

## 🛠️ Tools Created

### 1. **Python Script** (`cleanup_workflows.py`) - **RECOMMENDED**
- ✅ **Easy to use** with clear configuration
- ✅ **Dry run mode** to preview changes
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts** before deletion
- ✅ **Rate limiting protection**
- ✅ **Detailed analysis** of what will be deleted

### 2. **Bash Script** (`cleanup-old-workflows.sh`) - **ALTERNATIVE**
- ✅ **GitHub CLI integration**
- ✅ **JSON processing** with jq
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**
- ✅ **Automatic pagination**

### 3. **Comprehensive Guide** (`GITHUB_ACTIONS_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ **Step-by-step instructions**
- ✅ **Multiple methods** explained
- ✅ **Safety measures** and best practices
- ✅ **Automation options** for ongoing cleanup

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### Method 1: Python Script (Recommended)

1. **Get GitHub Token**:
   ```bash
   # Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   # Create token with 'repo' permissions
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Run Dry Run First**:
   ```bash
   # Edit cleanup_workflows.py to set DRY_RUN = True
   python3 cleanup_workflows.py
   ```

4. **Perform Actual Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Edit cleanup_workflows.py to set DRY_RUN = False
   python3 cleanup_workflows.py
   ```

### Method 2: Manual via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/TechTyphoon/secure-flow-automaton/actions
2. Click on "reliable-ci.yml" workflow
3. Delete old runs manually using the "..." menu

## 📈 Expected Results

After cleanup:
- **Keep**: 10 most recent workflow runs
- **Delete**: 29 older workflow runs
- **Benefits**: 
  - 🗂️ Free up storage space
  - ⚡ Faster workflow history loading
  - 🧹 Cleaner repository history
  - 💰 Reduced storage costs

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- ✅ **Dry run mode** to preview changes
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts** before deletion
- ✅ **Recent run protection** (always keeps latest)
- ✅ **Error handling** and graceful failures
- ✅ **Rate limiting** protection

## 🔄 Automation Options

### Option 1: Add to Existing Workflow
Add this to your `.github/workflows/reliable-ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Cleanup old workflow runs
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    # Keep only the last 10 runs
    gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs \
      --paginate \
      --jq '.workflow_runs[10:].id' \
      | xargs -I {} gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/{} \
      --method DELETE
```

### Option 2: Scheduled Cleanup
Create `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`:

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Workflows
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Every Sunday at 2 AM
jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cleanup old workflow runs
        run: python3 cleanup_workflows.py
```

## 📋 Files Created

1. **`cleanup_workflows.py`** - Main Python cleanup script
2. **`cleanup-old-workflows.sh`** - Alternative bash script
3. **`GITHUB_ACTIONS_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide
4. **`CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run the Python script in dry run mode to see what would be deleted
2. **Review**: Check the analysis and ensure you're comfortable with the changes
3. **Execute**: Run the actual cleanup when ready
4. **Automate**: Set up ongoing cleanup to maintain clean history

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Always run dry run first** to preview changes
- **Keep recent runs** - they contain important debugging information
- **Monitor after cleanup** to ensure everything works correctly
- **Set up automation** to prevent future accumulation of old runs
- **Adjust `MAX_RUNS_TO_KEEP`** based on your specific needs

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the comprehensive guide in `GITHUB_ACTIONS_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Ensure your GitHub token has proper permissions
3. Verify network connectivity and rate limits
4. Start with dry run mode to test the process
