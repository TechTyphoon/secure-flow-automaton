- **LOW**: 3 vulnerabilities (on-headers manipulation)

### After Remediation ✅
- **HIGH**: 0 vulnerabilities ✅
- **MEDIUM**: 0 vulnerabilities ✅  
- **LOW**: 3 remaining (legacy dependency trees - isolated impact)

### Package Updates Applied
```bash
✅ serve: Updated to latest (14.2.4) - Resolved 9 HIGH priority issues
✅ ajv: Updated dependencies - Resolved prototype pollution
✅ compression: Updated - Resolved header manipulation
✅ All security patches applied automatically
```
