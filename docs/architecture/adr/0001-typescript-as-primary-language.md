# [ADR-001] TypeScript as Primary Language

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Secure Flow Automaton project needed to choose a primary programming language that would provide:
- Strong type safety for enterprise-grade security applications
- Excellent developer experience and tooling
- Interoperability with existing JavaScript ecosystem
- Long-term maintainability for complex business logic
- Support for modern web development patterns

## Decision
We have chosen **TypeScript** as the primary language for the Secure Flow Automaton project.

### Rationale
1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, reducing runtime errors in security-critical applications
2. **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support, autocompletion, and refactoring tools
3. **JavaScript Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing JavaScript libraries and tools
4. **Enterprise Adoption**: Widely adopted in enterprise environments with strong community support
5. **Future-Proof**: Backed by Microsoft and actively maintained with regular updates

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Reduced Bugs**: Compile-time type checking catches many errors before runtime
- **Better Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation for APIs and data structures
- **Improved Refactoring**: Safe refactoring with confidence that breaking changes are caught
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better autocomplete, error detection, and navigation
- **Team Productivity**: Faster development with fewer runtime debugging sessions

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn TypeScript if not already familiar
- **Build Complexity**: Additional compilation step required
- **Bundle Size**: Slight increase in bundle size due to type information (can be removed in production)
- **Tooling Requirements**: Need for TypeScript-aware build tools and editors

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Pure JavaScript
- **Pros**: No compilation step, immediate execution, wider developer pool
- **Cons**: No type safety, harder to maintain large codebases, more runtime errors
- **Rejection Reason**: Type safety is critical for security applications

### 2. Python
- **Pros**: Excellent for data processing, strong security libraries, readable syntax
- **Cons**: Limited web development ecosystem, slower execution, different deployment model
- **Rejection Reason**: Web application focus and existing JavaScript infrastructure

### 3. Go
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, built-in concurrency, strong typing
- **Cons**: Limited web development ecosystem, different deployment model, team expertise
- **Rejection Reason**: Web application focus and existing JavaScript infrastructure

### 4. Rust
- **Pros**: Memory safety, performance, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, limited web development support, different deployment model
- **Rejection Reason**: Web application focus and existing JavaScript infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration
- TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode enabled
- ESLint with TypeScript-specific rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- Vitest for testing with TypeScript support

### Build Process
- Vite for development and building
- TypeScript compilation integrated into build pipeline
- Type checking as part of CI/CD process

### Development Workflow
- All new code written in TypeScript
- Gradual migration of existing JavaScript code
- Type definitions for external libraries where needed
