# [ADR-002] Modular Architecture with Apps Directory

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Secure Flow Automaton project needed an architecture that would:
- Support multiple application modules with different purposes
- Allow independent development and deployment of components
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Support different technology stacks for different modules
- Enable team autonomy and parallel development
- Scale with the growing complexity of the platform

## Decision
We have adopted a **modular architecture** using an `apps/` directory structure where each application module is self-contained with its own configuration, dependencies, and build processes.

### Architecture Structure
```
secure-flow-automaton/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                    # Main web application (React + TypeScript)
│   │   ├── src/               # Source code
│   │   ├── package.json       # Module-specific dependencies
│   │   └── tsconfig.json      # Module-specific TypeScript config
│   ├── quantum-edge/          # Quantum computing module
│   │   ├── src/               # Source code
│   │   ├── package.json       # Module-specific dependencies
│   │   └── tsconfig.json      # Module-specific TypeScript config
│   └── [future-modules]/      # Additional modules as needed
├── shared/                     # Shared utilities and types
├── tools/                      # Development and build tools
└── docs/                       # Documentation
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Modularity**: Each application can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different modules without conflicts
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each module can use the most appropriate technology stack
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules without affecting existing ones
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make the codebase easier to understand and maintain
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Modules can be deployed to different environments or schedules

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: More complex project structure and build processes
- **Dependency Management**: Potential for dependency duplication across modules
- **Build Coordination**: Need to coordinate builds and deployments across modules
- **Learning Curve**: New developers need to understand the modular structure
- **Tooling Requirements**: Need for tools that support monorepo workflows

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler structure, single build process, easier dependency management
- **Cons**: Tight coupling, harder to scale teams, deployment complexity
- **Rejection Reason**: Need for team autonomy and independent scaling

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Complete independence, different technology stacks, independent scaling
- **Cons**: Network complexity, distributed system challenges, operational overhead
- **Rejection Reason**: Too complex for current team size and requirements

### 3. Layered Architecture
- **Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, familiar pattern
- **Cons**: Tight coupling between layers, harder to scale horizontally
- **Rejection Reason**: Need for independent module development

### 4. Plugin Architecture
- **Pros**: Extensible, dynamic loading
- **Cons**: Complex plugin management, version compatibility issues
- **Rejection Reason**: Need for more structured module boundaries

## Implementation Notes

### Module Structure
Each module in the `apps/` directory follows this structure:
- `src/` - Source code
- `package.json` - Module-specific dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tests/` - Module-specific tests
- `docs/` - Module-specific documentation

### Shared Resources
- Common utilities in `shared/` directory
- Shared types and interfaces
- Common build and development tools
- Shared testing utilities

### Build Process
- Each module can be built independently
- Root-level scripts for building all modules
- Shared build configuration where appropriate
- Module-specific build customization when needed

### Dependency Management
- Module-specific dependencies in each `package.json`
- Shared dependencies managed at root level
- Workspace-aware package management
- Consistent versioning across modules
