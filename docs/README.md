## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Secure Flow Automaton follows a **modular, microservices-based architecture** designed for:

- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of different components
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Security**: Comprehensive security scanning and monitoring
- **Observability**: Full-stack monitoring and alerting
- **DevOps**: Automated CI/CD and deployment processes

### Key Architectural Decisions

We document all significant architectural decisions in [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](architecture/adr/README.md). These include:

- **Technology Choices**: Why we chose specific technologies
- **Architecture Patterns**: Design patterns and their rationale
- **Trade-offs**: Analysis of alternatives and decisions made
- **Implementation Notes**: How decisions were implemented

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Task Runner
We provide a consistent interface through our [Makefile](../../Makefile) for common development tasks:

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make install           # Install dependencies
make test              # Run tests
make build             # Build the application
make security-check    # Run security scans
make health-check      # Run project health checks
```

### Package Scripts
Additional npm scripts are available for specific tasks:

```bash
npm run dev            # Start development server
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint           # Run linting
npm run type-check     # Run TypeScript type checking
```
