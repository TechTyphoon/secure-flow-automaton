# Phase 4: Zero Trust Architecture Implementation

## 🛡️ Zero Trust Security Framework

**Phase 4** implements comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture with never trust, always verify principles, continuous authentication, micro-segmentation, and least privilege access controls.

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 4.1: Identity & Access Management (IAM) Foundation
- ✅ Zero Trust Identity Provider
- ✅ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Engine
- ✅ Continuous Authentication System
- ✅ Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- ✅ Identity Governance & Administration

### Phase 4.2: Network Micro-Segmentation
- 🔄 Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)
- 🔄 Network Access Control (NAC)
- 🔄 Micro-Segmentation Engine
- 🔄 East-West Traffic Inspection
- 🔄 Dynamic Policy Enforcement

### Phase 4.3: Device Trust & Compliance
- ⏳ Device Identity & Registration
- ⏳ Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Integration
- ⏳ Device Compliance Validation
- ⏳ Certificate-Based Authentication
- ⏳ Mobile Device Management (MDM)

### Phase 4.4: Data Protection & Classification
- ⏳ Data Discovery & Classification
- ⏳ Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- ⏳ Rights Management & Encryption
- ⏳ Data Access Governance
- ⏳ Privacy Controls & Compliance

## 🚀 Current Status: Phase 4.1 - IAM Foundation

Starting implementation of Zero Trust Identity & Access Management foundation with advanced authentication, authorization, and continuous verification capabilities.
