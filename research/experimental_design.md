## Experimental Design

### Study Type: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- **Design**: Mixed-methods, multi-site randomized controlled trial
- **Duration**: 12 weeks (4 weeks baseline + 8 weeks treatment)
- **Randomization**: Block randomization by organization size and industry
- **Blinding**: Single-blind (data analysts blinded to group assignment)

### Sample Size Calculation

```r
# Power analysis for primary outcomes
library(pwr)

# For t-test comparing two means
# Effect size d = 0.8 (large effect)
# Power = 0.80, Alpha = 0.05

power_analysis <- pwr.t.test(
  d = 0.8,           # Expected effect size
  sig.level = 0.05,  # Alpha level
  power = 0.80,      # Desired power
  type = "two.sample",
  alternative = "two.sided"
)

# Result: n = 26 per group
# With 20% attrition: n = 32 per group
# Total organizations needed: 64
# Actual recruitment target: 8 organizations (over-powered for clustered design)
```

### Randomization Procedure

```python
import random
import pandas as pd

def randomize_organizations(orgs_df):
    """
    Block randomization by organization size and industry
    """
    # Stratify by size and industry
    strata = orgs_df.groupby(['size', 'industry'])
    
    randomized_orgs = []
    
    for (size, industry), group in strata:
        # Shuffle within each stratum
        group = group.sample(frac=1, random_state=42)
        
        # Alternate assignment within stratum
        for i, (idx, org) in enumerate(group.iterrows()):
            assignment = 'treatment' if i % 2 == 0 else 'control'
            randomized_orgs.append({
                'org_id': org['org_id'],
                'size': size,
                'industry': industry,
                'assignment': assignment
            })
    
    return pd.DataFrame(randomized_orgs)

# Example usage
orgs = pd.DataFrame({
    'org_id': range(1, 9),
    'size': ['small', 'medium', 'large'] * 3,
    'industry': ['fintech', 'healthcare', 'ecommerce'] * 3
})

randomization = randomize_organizations(orgs)
```

### Statistical Analysis Plan

**Primary Analysis: Intention-to-Treat (ITT)**
- All randomized participants included regardless of protocol adherence
- Missing data handled using multiple imputation
- Significance level: α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

**Secondary Analysis: Per-Protocol**
- Only participants with ≥80% protocol adherence
- Sensitivity analysis for missing data assumptions

**Statistical Methods**

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Means, standard deviations, medians, IQRs for continuous variables
   - Frequencies and percentages for categorical variables
   - 95% confidence intervals for all estimates

2. **Primary Hypothesis Testing**
   ```r
   # Performance analysis (MANOVA)
   manova_result <- manova(cbind(lcp, fid, cls) ~ group + size + industry, 
                           data = performance_data)
   
   # Security analysis (Mixed-effects model accounting for clustering)
   library(lme4)
   security_model <- lmer(detection_time ~ group + (1|organization), 
                          data = security_data)
   
   # User engagement (Generalized linear mixed model)
   engagement_model <- glmer(engagement_score ~ group + (1|organization), 
                            family = gaussian, data = user_data)
   ```

3. **Effect Size Calculations**
   - Cohen's d for continuous outcomes
   - Odds ratios for binary outcomes
   - Practical significance thresholds defined a priori

4. **Multiple Comparisons Adjustment**
   - Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate
   - False Discovery Rate (FDR) control for exploratory analyses

### Quality Assurance Measures

**Data Quality Control**
```python
def data_quality_checks(data):
    quality_report = {
        'missing_data': data.isnull().sum() / len(data),
        'outliers': detect_outliers_iqr(data),
        'consistency': check_logical_consistency(data),
        'completeness': check_minimum_sample_size(data)
    }
    
    # Automated quality alerts
    if quality_report['missing_data'].max() > 0.05:
        send_alert("Missing data exceeds 5% threshold")
    
    if quality_report['outliers'].sum() > len(data) * 0.1:
        send_alert("Outliers exceed 10% of sample")
    
    return quality_report

def detect_outliers_iqr(data):
    Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers = ((data < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))
    return outliers

def check_logical_consistency(data):
    # Example: completion time should be positive
    # engagement scores should be within valid range
    consistency_checks = {
        'positive_times': (data['completion_time'] > 0).all(),
        'valid_scores': ((data['satisfaction'] >= 1) & 
                        (data['satisfaction'] <= 5)).all()
    }
    return all(consistency_checks.values())
```
