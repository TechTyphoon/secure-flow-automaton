   - Support contacts

## Verification

### Remaining Clean Files
- Core documentation focuses on production use
- Deployment guides for real environments
- User manuals for operators
- Architecture documentation for system design
- API documentation for integrations

## Next Steps for Production

1. Configure real API tokens for all integrations

5. Implement backup and disaster recovery
6. Set up CI/CD pipelines
7. Configure security scanning
