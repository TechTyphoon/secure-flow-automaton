# Deployment Guide for Quantum Edge Computing Platform

## Introduction
This deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Quantum Edge Computing Platform. It covers the necessary prerequisites, configuration settings, and deployment procedures to ensure a successful implementation.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the Quantum Edge Computing Platform, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - A compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
   - Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm installed.
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed for containerized deployment.

2. **Access Requirements**
   - Administrative access to the deployment environment.
   - Access to cloud services or on-premises infrastructure as required.

3. **Configuration Files**
   - Ensure that the configuration files located in the `src/config` directory are properly set up:
     - `quantum-config.ts`: Quantum-specific settings.
     - `network-config.ts`: Network-related settings.
     - `deployment-config.ts`: Deployment settings.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the Quantum Edge Computing repository to your local machine or server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quantum-edge-phase6.git
cd quantum-edge-phase6
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Build the Project
Build the project to compile TypeScript files and prepare for deployment.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Set up the necessary environment variables for your deployment. This may include database connections, API keys, and other sensitive information.

### Step 5: Deploy the Application
You can deploy the application using Docker or directly via Node.js.

#### Option A: Docker Deployment
1. Build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t quantum-edge-app .
```

2. Run the Docker container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 quantum-edge-app
```

#### Option B: Node.js Deployment
Run the application directly using Node.js.

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment
After deployment, verify that the application is running correctly by accessing the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 7: Monitor the Application
Use the monitoring tools provided in the `src/services/deployment/monitoring.ts` file to track the performance and health of the deployed services.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

- Check the logs for any error messages.
- Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed and up to date.
