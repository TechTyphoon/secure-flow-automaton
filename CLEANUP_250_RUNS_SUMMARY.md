# 🎯 Delete First 250 Workflow Runs - Summary

## ✅ **Updated Cleanup Tools**

I've successfully updated the cleanup scripts to handle your specific requirement: **Delete the first 250 workflow runs out of 333 total**.

## 📊 **Current Situation**

- **Total Workflow Runs**: 333 (as shown in GitHub interface)
- **Target**: Delete the first 250 runs
- **Keep**: 83 most recent runs
- **Space Saved**: Significant storage and cleaner history

## 🛠️ **Updated Tools**

### 1. **Python Script** (`cleanup_workflows.py`) - **RECOMMENDED**
- ✅ **Configured to delete first 250 runs**
- ✅ **Sorts by creation date** (oldest first)
- ✅ **Dry run mode** to preview changes
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts** before deletion
- ✅ **Rate limiting protection**

### 2. **Bash Script** (`cleanup-old-workflows.sh`) - **ALTERNATIVE**
- ✅ **Configured to delete first 250 runs**
- ✅ **GitHub CLI integration**
- ✅ **JSON processing** with jq
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**

## 🔧 **Configuration**

Both scripts are now configured with:
```python
# Python script
DELETE_FIRST_N_RUNS = 250  # Delete the first 250 workflow runs
DRY_RUN = True  # Set to False for actual deletion
```

```bash
# Bash script
DELETE_FIRST_N_RUNS=250  # Delete the first 250 workflow runs
DRY_RUN=true  # Set to false to perform actual deletion
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start Instructions**

### Method 1: Python Script (Recommended)

1. **Get GitHub Token**:
   ```bash
   # Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   # Create token with 'repo' permissions
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Run Dry Run First**:
   ```bash
   # Script is already set to DRY_RUN = True
   python3 cleanup_workflows.py
   ```

4. **Perform Actual Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Edit cleanup_workflows.py to set DRY_RUN = False
   python3 cleanup_workflows.py
   ```

### Method 2: Bash Script

1. **Install and Authenticate**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gh jq
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Run Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Script is already set to DRY_RUN=true
   ./cleanup-old-workflows.sh
   ```

## 📈 **Expected Results**

After cleanup:
- **Delete**: 250 oldest workflow runs
- **Keep**: 83 most recent workflow runs
- **Benefits**: 
  - 🗂️ Free up significant storage space
  - ⚡ Much faster workflow history loading
  - 🧹 Much cleaner repository history
  - 💰 Reduced storage costs

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

- ✅ **Dry run mode** to preview changes
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts** before deletion
- ✅ **Sorts by creation date** (oldest first)
- ✅ **Error handling** and graceful failures
- ✅ **Rate limiting** protection

## 🔍 **What the Scripts Will Show**

The scripts will display:
1. **Total runs found**: 333
2. **Runs to delete**: 250 (first 250 by creation date)
3. **Runs to keep**: 83 (most recent)
4. **Preview of runs to be deleted** (first 10)
5. **Preview of runs to keep** (last 5)

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted runs cannot be recovered
- **Dry Run First**: Always run in dry run mode first to preview
- **Rate Limiting**: Scripts handle GitHub API rate limits automatically
- **Confirmation**: Manual confirmation required before actual deletion

## 🎯 **Ready to Execute**

The scripts are ready to use! They will:
1. Fetch all 333 workflow runs
2. Sort them by creation date (oldest first)
3. Delete the first 250 runs
4. Keep the 83 most recent runs

**Start with the dry run to see exactly what will be deleted!**
