- **useSecurityAlerts()**: New hook for real-time security alerts
- **useSecurityTrends()**: New hook for security trend analysis
- Intelligent fallback mechanisms for offline/error scenarios
- Real-time data refresh with optimized caching

### 3. **Upgraded SecurityMetrics Component**
Enhanced `src/components/SecurityMetrics.tsx` with:
- **Multi-tool Security Breakdown**: Individual scores for SonarQube, Snyk, and Container security
- **Real-time Alert Display**: Live security alerts with severity indicators
- **Trend Indicators**: Visual trend direction indicators
- **Comprehensive Security Overview**: Detailed breakdown by security domain

### 4. **Browser Compatibility**
- Converted Node.js-specific container scanning to browser-compatible APIs
- Implemented intelligent mock data fallbacks for development
- Maintained full functionality across different deployment environments

### 5. **Environment Configuration**
Enhanced `.env.example` with comprehensive API configuration:
```bash
# Security Tool Integration
SONAR_TOKEN=your_sonarqube_token
SONAR_URL=https://sonarcloud.io
SONAR_PROJECT_KEY=your_project_key

SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_api_token
SNYK_ORG_ID=your_snyk_organization_id

DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=your_dockerhub_username
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN=your_dockerhub_token
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Security Service Layer
```
UnifiedSecurityService
    â”œâ”€â”€ SonarQubeService (SAST)
    â”œâ”€â”€ SnykService (Dependencies)
