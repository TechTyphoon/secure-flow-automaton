## Literature Analysis Framework

### Research Gaps Identified
1. **Integration Gap**: Lack of unified DevSecOps + RUM platforms
2. **Offline Security Gap**: No existing offline security scanning solutions
3. **Business Impact Gap**: Limited correlation between security/performance and business metrics
4. **Real-time Gap**: Insufficient real-time security monitoring solutions
