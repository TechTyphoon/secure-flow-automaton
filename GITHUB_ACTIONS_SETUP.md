# GitHub Actions Configuration Guide

## ðŸš« Current Status: Workflows Fixed
Your GitHub Actions workflows were failing because they were running automatically on every push and missing required secrets. I've fixed this by:

1. **Changed triggers** - Workflows now run only on manual trigger or weekly schedule
2. **Added error handling** - Missing secrets won't cause failures
3. **Optimized workflows** - Better performance and cleaner output

## ðŸ”§ Required GitHub Secrets Configuration

To enable full functionality, configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Navigate to: `Settings` â†’ `Secrets and variables` â†’ `Actions`

### Essential Secrets:
```
SONARCLOUD_TOKEN          # SonarCloud integration (optional)
SUPABASE_URL              # Your Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY # Supabase service role key
SNYK_TOKEN               # Snyk security scanning (optional)
```

### How to Get Each Secret:

#### 1. SONARCLOUD_TOKEN (Optional - for code quality analysis)
- Visit [SonarCloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io)
- Create account and link to GitHub
- Go to `My Account` â†’ `Security` â†’ `Generate Token`
- Copy token and add to GitHub secrets

#### 2. SUPABASE_URL & SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Visit your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Select your project
- Go to `Settings` â†’ `API`
- Copy the `Project URL` (SUPABASE_URL)
- Copy the `service_role` key (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)

#### 3. SNYK_TOKEN (Optional - for vulnerability scanning)
- Visit [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
- Create account
- Go to `Account Settings` â†’ `API Token`
- Copy token and add to GitHub secrets

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Triggers

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Security Pipeline | Manual + PR to main | Code security validation |
| DevSecOps Pipeline | Manual only | Full security scan |
| Production Security | Manual + Weekly | Production environment checks |
| Security Scan | Manual + Weekly | Comprehensive security audit |

## ðŸ”’ Security Benefits

### What's Working Now (No Secrets Required):
- âœ… ESLint security scanning
- âœ… npm audit vulnerability checks
- âœ… Build and test validation
- âœ… Artifact upload for review

### What Will Work With Secrets:
- ðŸ”§ SonarCloud code quality analysis
- ðŸ”§ Trivy container security scanning
- ðŸ”§ Database integration for results tracking
- ðŸ”§ Advanced vulnerability reporting

## ðŸš€ Manual Execution

To run workflows manually:
1. Go to `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click `Run workflow` button
4. Choose the branch and click `Run workflow`

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Setup Steps

1. **Immediate** (No secrets needed):
   - Workflows will run successfully now
   - Basic security scanning works
   - Build and tests complete

2. **Enhanced** (With secrets):
   - Add SUPABASE secrets for data integration
   - Add SONARCLOUD_TOKEN for quality analysis
   - Add SNYK_TOKEN for vulnerability scanning

## ðŸŽ‰ All Fixed!

Your workflows will no longer fail automatically. They're now configured to:
- Run only when you want them to
- Handle missing secrets gracefully
- Provide clear feedback about what's working
- Upload results as downloadable artifacts

**No more automatic failures!** ðŸŽ‰
